TV show Library on the Net

## description
TV show discovery web app using the open-source Movie Database API. built using Express, React, and Node. 

### Practical take home assignment 
* A Potential employer has given me a assignment to create an application using their movies/Tv shows API to create a browsable tv show app, similar to a netflix or hulu. the api doesn't provide actual videos. I just needed a popular show page, and the ability to navigate through the selections, filter, or select a show to see more information. 

* I must include reasoning behind my technical choices. This may include trade-offs I might have made, anything I left out, and what I might do differently if I had more time to spend on the project.


### Explanation 
* I chose to use the MERN stack because it is my favorite combination of framework and libraries to make an application.
